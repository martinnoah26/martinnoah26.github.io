My name is Steven Noah Martin. I’m a graduate of McComb High School Class of 2016, where I was ranked #11 in my class with a 3.82 GPA. I was a member of the National Honor Society, The Superintendent’s Student Advisory Board, Excel Club, National History Day, Yearbook Committee, just to name a few.  I enjoy singing, working out, reading books, and anything else that challenges me mentally, physically, and/or emotionally. I also have been working at Golden Corral in McComb, MS as a Waiter/Server since January 2016. I’m an extremely outgoing and funny individual. Although, I can become something of an introvert at times. Most importantly, I’m God fearing and I do my best to please Him in everything I do.
